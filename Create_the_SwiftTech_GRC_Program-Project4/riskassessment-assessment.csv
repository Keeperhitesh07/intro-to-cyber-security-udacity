1,AES-128 is not so strong and is pretty easy to decipher,Information Security Risk,VPC3 File storage only supports AES-128 Encryption,Medium,High,AES-128 encryption is not so strong and the chance of an attacker to decipher is pretty high. Once the content is deciphered then the attacker might use data do fullfil all his intentions which may or maynot be good.,Placeholder       Assume none,Medium
2,Unencrypted data in databases can lead to loss of privacy or confidentiality,Information Security Risk,Databases in production are unencrypted,Medium,High,"Databases generally store large amounts of data like login details, names, address etc. If these are not encrypted then are easily available to the attackers who wants to get their hands on them. This may lead to loss of data, privacy and confidentiality.",Placeholder       Assume none,Medium
2b,,,Databases in production are unencrypted,,,,Placeholder       Assume none,
3,Minimum length of a password is 8. If the password is not meeting the requirement it can be easily cracked ,Technology Risk,Internal network users require a 7-character password,Low ,High,"The chance of the attacker knowing that the password is weak is very low. But once the attacker crackers the password, he/she can do anything that he wants to do. Which can cause high impact on the victim.",Placeholder       Assume none,Medium 
4,Passwords which does not have an expiry date can give more time to the attacker to crack the passwords. It is recommended to change the password every 90 days.,Information Security Risk,Passwords never expire,Medium,High,"Brute force attacks take some time to crack the passwords. If the password doesn’t expire, then it gives the attacker more time to crack the password. Once the password is cracked then the attacker gains access to the credentials and can perform unauthorized tasks. ",Placeholder       Assume none,Medium
5,Without an MFA there are chances of an unauthorized persson getting access to the VPN which is not supposed to happen,Information Security Risk,VPN Access does not require MFA,Medium,High,When there is not MFA the number of layers to crack is less. The chance of attacker getting in is pretty high. Once it is cracked then the attacker can gain access to the VPN and can gain access to the data.,Placeholder       Assume none,Medium
6,TLS V1.1 uses MD5 and SHA-1 which are broken hash functions,Business Risk,TLS V1.1 is used between the cloud production environment and SwiftTechâ€™s physical location,Medium ,Medium,SSL certificates using SHA-1 is no longer supported. This reduces the availability of the desired environment.  ,Placeholder       Assume none,Medium
7,When Application development Tier is hacked then there is a risk of Business application server to be exposed.,Technical Environment Risk,Application development Tiers are not logically segmented from Business Application servers,Medium,High,If both Application Development Tier and Business Application server are coupled together then if one of them is exploited then both of them are in a risk of exposure.,Placeholder       Assume none,Medium
7b,,,Application development Tiers are not logically segmented from Business Application servers,,,,Placeholder       Assume none,
8,Unpatched servers can be easily exploited and it might cause lose of data and access to the systems,Technical Environment Risk,Development Tier servers are unpatched and contain multiple vulnerabilities,High,High,"Unpatched servers attract more number of attackers. Unpatched servers have several vulnerabilities and the chance of an attack on it is very high. Once the attacker gains access to the server then there can be a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.",Placeholder       Assume none,High
9,Once an attacker finds a flaw or vulnerability and has the potential to exploit it then the attacker can exploit and again access to the information and the application.,Technical Environment Risk,Application code is not scanned for vulnerabilities before being published into production environment,High,High,If application code is not scanned for vulnerabilities then there is a high chance of an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Scripting. This may cause users to be redirected to sites which contain malicious content or download something malicious which cause fatal damages.,Placeholder       Assume none,High

Notes:,,,,,,,,
Risk - descriptions should be some reasonable approximation of what is written above but does not need to be exact,,,,,,,,
"Reasoning - The reasoning should approximately match to the user's assessment of the likelihood and impact of a potential risk.  If, for instance the likelihood and impact are marked high, the reasoning should reflect why it might be high",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Mitigating Controls - For the purpose of this exercise we did not include mitigating controls,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Total Risk Score - Should not be less than a reasonable approximation of the likelihood x impact.  For instance, if L=High and I=High (and no mitigating control exists) then Risk cannot equal Low",,,,,,,,
